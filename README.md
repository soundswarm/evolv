This app is built with React, boostrap v4, and firebase

This app shows an educational video then asks the watcher to take a quiz. The playback rate of the video is randomly chosen from three speeds (.5x, 1x, 1.25x). These are three hypotheses whose relationship to test score is tested.
The results of the quiz and the video-watching behavior are recorded and displayed after completing the quiz.  These results are stored in a firebase database.

In the results section of the app, stats across all quiz takers are shown.  These include:
  1) the correlation of video playback rate to quiz score. 
  2) the correlation of pause count to quiz score
